# Chess3D

This is my project in my C++ class. This is an implementation of a chess game with 3d-graphics. It takes advantage of @MarkarenÂ´s port to c++ of the popular
3D-graphics library Threejs called Threepp.

What you can do in this project.
Gamemodes:
1. PVP
2. Play vs basic AI
3. Multiplayer
